This script has been made to do a little social experiment, trying to apply A/B testing to Tinder.
Please do not abuse the Tinder community with this script. Try to meet girls in real life and preserve the dignity of human relationships.

Fully compatible with Facebook last update (August 2016).

# Requirements
A working Tinder account, connected to your Facebook account.
- Ruby >= 1.9.2
- Bundler (Install it with ```gem install bundler```)

**Attention for Mac OS X El Capitan Users:** run ```sudo gem install bundler -n /usr/local/bin``` to install Bundler.


# Usage

## How to use the script

1) Edit the file and insert your Facebook login/password at lines 22 & 23:

    myLogin = 'YOUR_FACEBOOK_EMAIL_ADDRESS'
    myPassword = 'YOUR_FACEBOOK_PASSWORD'

Please note that these data will be kept private and are just used to connect you to Facebook servers and fetch your Facebook token & id required by Tinder.

2) Launch the script.

    bundle install
    bundle exec ruby TinderAutoLike.rb

Please wait while the script connects you to Facebook, fetches your token & id, connects to the Tinder API and likes every user in your area.
Users liked will be put in the file "targets.txt".

3) Enjoy! Do some A/B testing to optimize your profile or study human relationships :).

## A/B Testing with TinderAutoLike

1) Create a profile and set up your account with a typical picture following one of those categories: adventure/selfie/group/fun.

2) Set up your description according to your picture.

3) Launch the script and wait for a week.

4) Count the number of matches you got and divide by the number of likes (see targets.txt) to get your ratio.

5) Delete your Tinder profile, create a new one and iterate.

# Results

Feel free to share your results with this repo.

Below are what we learnt so far with A/B testing.

##Your pictures
* 1st photo should be a fun one or showing adventure
* 2nd should be normal
* 3rd might be fun
* others pictures might be of your choice

##Your bio
Try to be out of the crowd! Say something fun and interesting that gives the envy to talk with you.

##The opener
Do not use something you found on Reddit/any forum. Be yourself. However, be fun and try to be teasing: there are a lot of creepy guys on the internet, and you have to show that you are not one of them.
